				Hi my name is Vijaya Anisetti. I'm currently a senior at UMass Lowell. I'm majoring in Computer Science and also receiving a minor in Mathematics. Currently I'm taking summer courses to stay on track to graduate in the spring as I will begin my 6 month co-op and miss out on the fall semester. I will be working in IT at Liberty Mutual Insurance which I look forward to. Besides those summer classes I've been paitning again. If I wasn't a computer science major I probabaly would've chosen the art path so it was nice to be able to be creative in that sense again. Some random fun facts about me are that I am allergic to walnuts, I went to boarding school and I like this ":)" emoji.
